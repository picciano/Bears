# JS Libraries

Libraries with existing repos on github or similar. These are vetted, dependable and popular Javascript libraries, plugins, etc.

## Modernizr

Modernizr includes a very basic custom build, please update the file as tests are needed instead of loading the whole development version. This will limit the tests to only those actually needed for the project. Lets prevent running every Modernizr test on every page load of sites we develop.
