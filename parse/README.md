#### Initial Setup

* Update project name in /README.md
* Update project name in /package.json

***

Project Name
===================

## Quick Start

* run `npm install && grunt build`
* run `grunt watch` while developing


## Development Notes

A few quick reminders as you are developing.

* When deleting .scss files make sure to run `grunt cleanup` or remove the /css/generated/ version of the deleted file
* Boilerplate contains the Underscore build of Lodash, so all [Lodash methods](http://lodash.com/docs) are available when required.
* [Accessibility checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html).
* [HTML5 Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list) on MDN

### Modernizr

Boilerplate has a custom build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/download/#-shiv-cssclasses) that includes the HTML5 shiv and CSS classes. Please update the file as tests are needed instead of loading the whole development version.

This approach will limit the Modernizr tests to only those needed for the project. As a benefit we prevent running every Modernizr test on every page load of the site.

### Grunt Tasks

* `grunt` or `grunt default` : builds only newer files with [grunt-newer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-newer)
* `grunt watch` : runs the default task above, run this task while developing
* `grunt build` : similar to the default task without limiting newer files
* `grunt cleanup` : removes all generated files, then runs the build task above
